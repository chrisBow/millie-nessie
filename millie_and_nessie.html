  It was January. Christmas was over. Millie had just been painting with her new watercolour paints when she had a thought. In January her class p6 would be doing an assembly on Scotland soon. Maybe she could draw Nessie. Millie searched for Nessie images and began to paint. Millie decided that she would take her picture into school the next day to share. Her teacher would love it.
</p>
<p>
  The next day Millie packed bag and put her new picture in her school bag. Little did she know that something interesting would be happening soonâ€¦
</p>
<p>
  On the way to school Millie wondered what would happen at school when she tripped and landed on the ground. Everything went black.

  On the way to school Millie wondered what would happen at school when she tripped and landed on the ground. Everything went black.
<p>
  To be honest, the area was mostly water. Maybe she should just leave.
</p>
<p>
  Millie slowly opened  her eyes to see a loch, but not any loch: Loch Ness. The first thing that came to mind was Nessie. Nessie was the loch ness monster. Millie decided to go and explore.
</p>
<p>
  As soon as she was thinking about leaving, a head popped out of the lock. Millie blinked, and then rubbed her eyes. Nothing was there! She tried to pretend she never saw anything, but that was difficult. With no idea what to do, she was stranded. Why would someone pick her up? Oh no. What would she do?
</p>
<p>
  Then Millie saw a tail splash the water. She could not be seeing things now! Millie went to hide. In her hiding spot, Millie fell asleep.
</p>
<p>
  In her dreams, Millie was walking to school. She had been thinking about what would happen in school, when she tripped and hit her head.
</p>
<p>
  Millie woke up. All of it had come back to her. The question was, however, how did she get to Loch Ness? Teleportation? Is it a dream? Millie got out of her hiding spot when she saw that the creature in the water wasn't a bear, it looked too like a crocodile...
</p>
<p>
  Millie always thought that Nessie was fake; maybe not. All she knew was that it was really late and she wanted to go to bed.
</p>
<p>
  The next day was when all the adventure began. She went to find food and once again saw Nessie. This time it was catching food with Millie. Something strange was going on. It did whatever Millie did, whenever she did it.
</p>
<p>
  Millie felt rain pitter patter on her head. As soon as she was thinking about getting back in the shelter, what looked like an ordinary man popped out of the water. Then Millie saw that it wasn't an ordinary man at all, it was a merman. He said that he had been abandoned by his school when he did something naughty. Then Nessie encouraged him to get into the water and it turned him into a merman. Perhaps it could turn Millie into a mermaid. She tried it and it worked. She could breathe underwater!
</p>
<p>
  Millie hid in a cave with Nessie and the merman. When the rain was over, he showed Millie the cave and how to leave. The merman didn't want to leave.
</p>
<p>
  "But surely he must miss his family," thought Millie. However, Millie wanted to go, so she could practise for her assembly. She did exactly what the merman had taught her to do to leave Loch Ness. Millie went through the cave.
</p>
<p>
  Millie woke up. She woke up exactly where she had fallen. Now, however, a boy who looked just like the merman was sitting next to her. He explained that he was new to the school that Millie went to.
</p>
<p>
  Millie showed the new boy around the school and then Millie noticed something: he was wearing a Nessie backpack. On the bright side, at least Millie could show her picture to her class.
